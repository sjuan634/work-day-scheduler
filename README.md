# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the standard business day.

The HTML elements for each time-block are dynamically added using javaScript. Styling to them is also applied using condition logic. It uses Dayjs to evaluate whether the time-block should be styled with a past present or future class.

The user input is saved to localStorage when they click the save button. When the page is loaded again the values persist.

The user can clear the calendar by clicking the clear button. That clears the values for each textarea as well as localStorage.
